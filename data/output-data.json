      "When I went down to the litho shop to sell my first drawing, I was very nervous wondering whether they would buy it or not. My first drawing was an image of my late grandfather’s (Latchaolassie) carving of a bird. I was so proud to get paid for that drawing and it inspired me to do more drawings. -Saimaiyu Akesuk",
      "Saimaiyu Akesuk was born on April 28, 1988 in Iqaluit but she has lived in Cape Dorset her whole life. Her parents are Lau Akesuk and Olayuk Akesuk who was one of the first Members of the Legislative Assembly in Nunavut. Saimaiyu was inspired to start drawing by Ningeokuluk Teevee while they were taking a class together at the Nunavut Teaching Education Program. Saimaiyu’s confident drawings of birds and bears are characterized by her bold and dynamic simplicity rendered with soft tenderness and quite often a touch of whimsy.",

      "KENOJUAK ASHEVAK",
      "1927-2013",
      "Kenojuak Ashevak was one of Canada’s most acclaimed graphic artists. Her long list of achievements and honours is surpassed only by her stamina and good humour.",
      "Born on south Baffin Island at a camp area known as Ikirisaq, Kenojuak grew up traveling from camp to camp on south Baffin and in Arctic Quebec (Nunavik). As a young woman, she was married to Johnniebo and lived with him in various camps including Keakto, a scenic area seven miles from Cape Dorset. While still living at Keakto in the late 1950's, both Kenojuak and Johnniebo first experimented with carving and drawing. They moved to Cape Dorset in 1966 in order for their children to attend school, and continued to work closely together until Johnniebo's death.\nKenojuak’s drawings were immediately captivating, and she was represented in almost every annual print collection since 1959. Her work has also been included in numerous special projects and commissions. In 1961 she was the subject of a film produced by the National Film Board about her traditional life and art. The film is still shown today, and was instrumental in introducing her to the world beyond Cape Dorset. In 1970 her print, Enchanted Owl (1960) was reproduced on a stamp commemorating the centennial of the Northwest Territories, and again in 1993 Canada Post selected her drawing entitled The Owl to be reproduced on their .86 cent stamp.",
      "Special commissions included the World Wildlife Print Portfolio released in 1978. In the same year, the Commonwealth Print Portfolio featured one of her works. Her art and life were the focus of the limited edition book entitled Graphic Arts of the Inuit: Kenojuak, published in 1981. In 1988, Via Rail Canada commissioned a large mural from Kenojuak for their Club Car series, which featured some of Canada’s most highly respected artists. Kenojuak's print Nunavut Qajanatuk (Our Beautiful Land) was commissioned by Indian and Northern Affairs Canada to commemorate the signing of the Inuit Land Claim Agreement in Principle, in April 1990. To commemorate the signing of the Final Agreement early in 1994, Kenojuak conceived and hand-coloured a large and exclusive lithograph entitled Nunavut.",
      "April 1st, 1999 marked the official inception of the new Territory of Nunavut in Canada’s Arctic. To commemorate this historic event, Dorset Fine Arts released a special edition of 99 prints by Kenojuak – a large diptych entitled Siilavut, Nunavut (Our Environment, Our Land).",
      "Kenojuak  received many special honours over the years. She was a Companion in the Order of Canada, which she originally received in 1967. In 1992, she was awarded Honourary Degrees from both Queen's University and the University of Toronto. In 1996 she received the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award at the National Aboriginal Achievement Awards Ceremony in Vancouver. In the spring of 2001, Kenojuak was inducted into Canada’s Walk of Fame, and traveled with her daughter, Silaqi, to attend the ceremonies in Toronto. She is the first Inuit artist to be so honoured, and joined many other famous and accomplished Canadians.",
      "Kenojuak traveled all over the world as an ambassador for Inuit art. In 1969, she and Johnniebo traveled to Ottawa to collaborate on a mural which hung in the Canadian Pavilion at Expo '70 in Osaka, Japan. In 1980, she traveled to Rotterdam, Holland to be present at The Inuit Print exhibition which was opened by the Queen of the Netherlands. In 1991, she traveled to Soeul, South Korea to attend the opening of an exhibition of prints and sculpture, and in 1994, she was invited to open the exhibition Arctic Spirit: 35 Years of Canadian Inuit Art at the Frye Art Museum in Seattle, Washington. She also traveled to Ottawa in the fall of 1994 for the opening of Isumavut: The Artistic Expression of Nine Cape Dorset Women. In 2004, she was off to Germany to take part in cultural festivities celebrating the territory of Nunavut, and her contribution to Inuit graphic art. Her major stained glass commission was installed in the fall of 2004 at the John Bell Chapel at Appleby College just west of Toronto.",
      "In the fall of 2007 Kenojuak traveled to Toronto to attend the launch of Cape Dorset Prints: A Retrospective – a major publication celebrating fifty years of printmaking at the Kinngait Studios. IN 2008, she added to her list of honours the Governor General’s Award for excellence in the visual arts. Sponsored by the Canada Council for the Arts, she traveled to Ottawa in March 2008 with her daughter, Silaqi, to attend the exhibition at the National Gallery and events at the residence of the Governor General. She was back in Ottawa in 2009 to participate in events surrounding the 50th anniversary of the Kinngait Studios.",
      "In January, 2013, after a long and illustrious career, Kenojuak died peacefully at home surrounded by her loving family.",

Ashoona died during a epidemic in the Nettling Lake area he was still in his prime, leaving Pitseolak to raise their young family on her own.  She settled permanently in Cape Dorset in the early 1960’s.",
      "Pitseolak was among the first in Cape Dorset to begin drawing, and the most prolific.  She made close to 9,000 drawings during her 20 years in Cape Dorset. Her prints have appeared in every annual print collection since her work was first published in 1960.  Her best and most authentic drawings were of “the old Eskimo ways”, a way of life deeply embedded in her memory. Pitseolak was been awarded several honours over the years, and her work has been the subject of several projects.  In 1971 the National Film Board produced a film based on her book, “Pitseolak: Pictures out of my life”.  In 1974 she was elected a member of the Royal Canadian Academy and she received the Order of Canada in 1977. Pitseolak died in 1983 and is buried behind the Anglican Church in Cape Dorset.  She fulfilled her promise to work on her drawings and prints until she was no longer able.  Her vast legacy of orginal work now resides on long term loan at the McMichael Canadian Art Collection where it is being photographed, documented and exhibited.*\n*West Baffin Island Co-op, 1999.",

      "For a very long time Mayoreak lived at an outpost camp and being great distances away from people demands self-sufficiency.  This required an income to provide for necessities.  So Mayoreak took up carving as well as drawing because it made economic sense to do so and also kept herself occupied.  Mayoreak’s carvings are very dynamic and strong and having uniquely feminine perspectives in their rendering as do her drawings.  You can see the influences from her background in the art she produces.  Ashoona draws in a variety of styles (including abstract) and the figures that she produces are engaged in a variety of activities.  Ashoona has in the context of her paintings and drawings an ability to explore, to work and capture the essence and master techniques of abstract or figurative representation through symmetry and balance.*",

She works with pen and ink, coloured pencils and oil sticks and her sensibility for the landscape around the community of Cape Dorset is particularly impressive.

      "Before his death in 1981, Kingmeata’s husband, Etidlooie Etidlooie, was a graphic and a print artist, a printmaker, sculptor, and painter in Cape Dorset.  Their children, Etulu Etidlui, Omalluq Oshutsiaq, Pukaluk Etungat and Kellypalik Etidlooie, and their grandson, Pitseolak Oshutsiaq, are sculptors.",
      "“Born at Itinik camp near Lake Harbour, Northwest Territories, Canada, Kingmeata Etidlooie grew up and spent most of the first half of her life in similar sites along the southwest coast of Baffin Island.   She began to carve and to draw in the late 1950’s after the death of her first husband, Elijah.  As with most Inuit artists of her generation, Kingmeata’s creative endeavours mark a second phase in her life –one that parallels the significant changes experienced by the indigenous people of the Canadian Arctic over the past five decades.  With her second husband, Etidlooie Etidlooie (1910 – 1981) and their family, Kingmeata moved into the settlement of Cape Dorset in the mid -1960’s, exchanging a seasonally-based cape for a permanent residence.  Both she and her husband became artist members of the West Baffin Eskimo Co-operative, recognized internationally for its printmaking studio and the strength of the graphic artists it represented.",
      "A relatively prolific artist, Kingmeata had more than fifty of her prints published between 1970 and her death in 1979. Her work is characterized by a strong sense of order and structure.  Using predominantly simplified animal and bird motifs, she concentrated on the formal rather than the narrative qualities of her subjects.  However, her most important contribution to Inuit art has probably been her experimentation with media that are more painterly than linear.  In the late 1960’s to the early 1970’s Kingmeata became one of the first Cape Dorset artists to work with watercolours, which hadbeen given to her by Terry Ryan, Co-op manager and arts advisor, who recognized the painterly qualities of her drawings.  In the mid-1970’s the presence of Toronto painter, K.M. Graham, provided a further catalyst who came North to sketch and work with acrylic paints in her own color-field style.  Graham was impressed by Kingmeata’s watercolours and offered her acrylics upon he departure.  When a painting studio was established by the Cooperative in 1976, Kingmeata, along with Pudlo Pudlat (b. 1916) was one of the most committed and enthusiastic users.  The rich, saturated colors that were now attainable seemed to mesh perfectly with her formal sense of composition.  In works such as,”Sea Creatures with Birds” (1976), color, shade, texture, and shape are enmeshed in a delightful, lyrical image.”",

      "Qavavau was born in Brandon, Manitoba in 1958 where his mother, Paunichea, was hospitalized for treatment of tuberculosis. He returned to Cape Dorset as a very young child and has lived there since. Qavavau has demonstrated a range of stylistic abilities over the years - from the very literal to the more expressive. His work is idiosyncratic and often amusing in his depictions of Inuit legends and mythology, Arctic wildlife and contemporary aspects of Inuit life Qavavau is the latest among the second generation to attract critical acclaim from the contemporary arts audience in the south. He and Shuvinai Ashoona have been profiled, along with Nick Sikkuark of Gjoa Haven, in the Winnipeg- based arts magazine, Border Crossings. He traveled to Toronto in June of 2008 for his first solo exhibition of original drawings, and in 2009 to Vancouver for another exhibition featuring his contemporary work. He was invited to attend an opening of his work in Victoria in the fall of 2012.",
      "For several years Qavavau has worked for the Kinngait Studios as a printmaker - first in the lithography studio and more recently in the stonecut studio. He is an accomplished and precise printmaker who enjoys the opportunity to demonstrate printmaking techniques to young artists and visitors to the studio.",

The bowhead in particular is a majestic and mysterious creature and frequently he will embellish his drawings of these animals with ‘tattoos’ of ancient artifacts. His artistic career was recently featured in the 2012 summer issue of The Walrus magazine and in 2013 he attended a very productive printmaking workshop at New Leaf Studios in Vancouver.

Born in 1951 in Kimmirut (formerly Lake Harbour) on southern Baffin Island, he moved to Cape Dorset when he was still a child. The son of artists Ishuhungitok and Paulassie Pootoogook, Itee has been drawing and carving for several years but it is only recently that he has been actively involved with Kinngait Studios in Cape Dorset. The first print edition of Itee’s work, Looking South, was released in the Spring of 2008 as part of the “Nine Works by Seven Artists” contemporary folio. This was followed by the Fall 2008 annual Cape Dorset print release, in which Itee’s work was featured with two of his recent prints.",
      "A meticulous draughtsman, Pootoogook looks primarily to contemporary northern life for his subject matter. He is especially interested in modern local architectural forms, producing works in graphite and coloured pencil that depict various contemporary buildings in Cape Dorset. Pootoogook’s portraits of acquaintances and family members similarly bear witness to the North of today. Whether they are captured at work or rest, Pootoogook’s subjects are shown engaged in a range of modern activities including stone carving and watching television indoors. Featuring a minimum of incident, these understated images celebrate the mundane moments that make up the everyday. Pootoogook is also an inventive landscapist. Many of his finest Arctic landscapes make use of extended formats, giving emphasis to the open horizon that separates land from sky. Although some compositions are produced from a combination of memory and imagination, Pootoogook bases many of his drawings on photographs, an aspect of his artistic process that further highlights his contemporaneity.",

While some of his carvings of human and animal subjects are compact, robust, solid and static, others are more open, outwardly thrusting, dynamic forms. His only print, “Wounded Caribou” (1961) is a very effective portrayal of an animal stricken by a hunter’s arrow.”* ",

      "Axangayuk was a natural sculptor and a proponent of sculpture in the round, emphasizing the qualities of volume, space and texture in his carvings. His subjects were suggested by the shape of the stone and although he shunned details, his work was imbued with a dynamic energy and dramatic expression. Blessed with a robust constitution,  Axangyauk  continued working up until the last few months of his life.",
      "Axangayuk was often asked to try his hand at drawing or printmaking but he preferred the physical process of carving stone. He did however create one of the most successful prints in the history of the Cape Dorset Annual Print collection, a 1961 stone cut titled ‘Wounded Caribou.’ Last year he hearkened back to that image, creating one of the most popular prints of the 2018 collection as well as a series of original drawings and etchings.",

Indeed, Qimirpik has successfully distinguished himself through this very juxtaposition, marrying pop-culture signifiers with traditional carving. He sits at the helm of a surging generation of Inuit artists who are reconfiguring their position onto history, traditional media, and narrative figuration. It’s a group who’s establishing itself through an aesthetic more easily situated in the contemporary artworld, while never fully divorced from its ancestral associations and formal base. Qimirpik, like so many of his contemporaries, continues to make the link between the two.",
      "From the age of thirteen, Qimirpik has established himself through an exceptional craftsmanship and an attention to contemporary signifiers. Producing figures like muskoxen, drum dancers, and dancing walruses, his works are often colored by their subjects’ props or profiles. They don iPods or MP3 Players (as in Young Man with MP3, 2010), the white of their devices’ matte cording cutting a stark contrast to veined marble. (The ironic value lies in this plastic veneer being made of bone). Rabbits dance to hip-hop. Walruses kick up their flippers with glee. Qimirpik is falling in step with his generation’s multivalence, its double-speak, and winking referentiality. He seeks form in Inuit history, but roots his subjects in the new. - TD BANK",
